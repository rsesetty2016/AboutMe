[Work Experience](#resume)

I have been working as IT specialist for over 25 years, covering from Traffic management to troubleshooting and monitoring of core systems and applications. I have been involved in automation and development of modules wherever necessary.

Have written more than 100,000 lines of code, worked as Principal Systems Administrator for over 3 years, around 4 years as Application Deployment Engineer, over 200 weeks of on-call support, over 2 years of BIG-IP F5 Loadbalancer support engineer, more than 100 Ansible playbooks, over 50 puppet manifests, around 250 Bladelogic jobs, deployed over 1000 VMs,  involved in 3 new datacenter setups, about 25 applications migrated between data centers, 10 major applications migrated to Cloud, and involved in periodic disaster recovery activities. 

Started off as a C programmer, and part time oracle database administrator, involved in different projects before becoming Solaris and Windows NT administrator. Moved to USA in 2000, started off as Sr. Application Engineer at Cisco Systems, CA. Joined GE/GXS in late 2000, handled multiple projects as Sr. Systems Analyst. I had handled different projects that involved with administration of Linux servers, WebLogic clustering, Tomcat containers, and Apache mod_proxy load balancing etc. During that tenure I was responsible for updating Oracle database schema in QA and Dev environments. Later moved onto Federal and local County, to automate and design DevOps pipelines with Virtualization and Containerization. I was responsible for designing systems that required traditional clustering methods, applications that were suitable to deploy in container model. I have handled projects that were migrated from on-premises to cloud, and projects with hybrid model.

Developed a tool, much similar to **Terraform**, to automate deployment of applications. It handles provisioning of infrastructure required by applications. It had remote locking to avoid any concurrent issues, install dependencies, handle pre and post implementation tasks.

Overseen and actively involved in development and deployment of applications that were developed based on NodeJS, React, Angular, Django, Yii, Springboot, MySQL, Postgres, MS SQL, Oracle and Mongodb. 

Python, Java and Perl are my preferences to implement any custom solutions for the businesses. 

Automation is my key strength and writing modules that are independent of third-party tools, so that business can migrate off easily. 

Implemented automation and Supported periodic Disaster/Recovery activities.

Adopt open-source tools that minimizes licensing and maintenance costs. Writing APIs and manage data from third party tools to generate custom reports and integrate different systems across organizations. 

Security and Quality of the service is most important factor in my system designs.  

Understand business requirements and come up with most optimal solutions that are cost effective, easy scale and implement. 

In summary, I am capable of designing and implement systems using  traditional deployment styles to modern deployments agile model.

###### GE – Information Systems/Global Exchange Services, Gaithersburg, MD
March 2010 – June 2012 & Nov 2000 - Aug 2008

Joined back in March 2010, as the business decided to move from two datacenter setup to four data center setup. Lead a team to migrate applications/users/filesystems from old systems to new systems. It was very critical to synchronize multiple appliances whenever a new service/application has been deployed. With multiple data centers, there was a great need to automate most of the system administration tasks, and deploying applications to different data centers with consistent changes depending on the environment. To handle this tough job, I came up with a framework, based on Java and JAXB, to automate most of these tasks. It was based on a XML configuration file, which drives the whole setup process, whenever a new host is being installed in a datacenter. This tool was heavily used to handle any repetitive tasks, independent of the environment (like qa/pre-production/staging/production). Not only sped up the setup time, but also avoids human errors while deploying an application to a specific environment.

This tool is production to create users, in mass, at UNIX level, replicate mount points, install RPMs, and lot more. General Unix administration has been automated to the extent possible, this will not only error free, it also validates all the requirements beforehand, so no mess.

Leading Automation team, the main object is to eliminate the release notes, make easy deployments, and mainly to eliminate human errors, thereby reducing the downtimes in actual production environments. Provide consultation to different teams on troubleshooting issues, suggest design improvements, and improve the quality of the products. Heavily involved in scripting and coding in different languages, to fasten the development process of automation and give motivation to the team members. Daily tasks include coordinating the team members at different locations across the globe, monitor the process, suggest improvements, and develop policies and procedures. I have been actively working on different projects that require Perl, PHP, MySQL, Oracle, and Java. Most of the tools are to improve the quality and turnaround time in delivering OS side functionality. Leading a team to develop infrastructure related tools and automation of application deployments using PHP 5.x with Yii framework.
