#### Ravi Sesetty
###### DevOps & Automation Engineer


I have been working as IT specialist for over 25 years, covering from Traffic management to troubleshooting and monitoring of core systems and applications. I have been involved in automation and development of modules wherever necessary.

Started off as a C programmer, and part time oracle database administrator, involved in different projects before becoming Solaris and Windows NT administration. Moved to USA in 2000, started off as Sr. Application Engineer at Cisco Systems, CA. Joined GE/GXS in late 2000, handled multiple projects as Sr. Systems Analyst. Later moved onto Federal and local County, to automate and design DevOps pipelines with Virtualization and Containerization. I was responsible for designing systems that required traditional clustering methods, applications that were suitable to deploy in container model. I have handled projects that were migrated from on-premises to cloud, and projects with hybrid model.

Automation is my key strength and writing modules that are independent of third-party tools, so that business can migrate off easily. 

Implemented Disaster/Recovery automation and involved in regular fail-over testing.

Adopt open-source tools that minimizes licensing and maintenance costs. Writing APIs and manage data from third party tools to generate custom reports and integrate different systems across organizations. 

Security and Quality of the service is most important factor in my system designs.  

My key strengths include understanding business requirements and come up with most optimal solutions that are cost effective and easy scale and implement. 

In summary, I went through traditional deployment styles to modern deployments in all areas from Operating Systems, networking, load balancing, clustering, developing applications, Virtualization, DevOps, Containerization and Cloud deployment.
