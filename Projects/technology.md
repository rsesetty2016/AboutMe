#### Development Stacks
> **NodeJS, Apache, Ngnix, React, Angular, Django, Yii, Mongodb, MySQL, Postgres, Oracle, DynamoDB**
>
> My role was not a developer, but assist developers to optimize and write modules or adaptors to connect to other solutions, such as OpenID Connect for SSO, SAML integration etc. Write any plugins that simplifies and provide more generic solutions that can be integrated with multiple projects. 

#### Code
> **Python, Java, Perl**
> 
> Developed numerous solutions that includes custom audits/alerts, web applications that provide ease of access to management, and insight into resources used, or custom mapping that were crucial in troubleshooting during the production issues. I have used formentioned techologies to achieve these tasks.  

#### Monitoring & Logs
> **Prometheus/Grafana, Zabbix, ELK Stack, GrayLog**
> 
> I have deployed Prometheus/Grafana to monitor K8s cluster. Deployed ELK cluster using Docker, and familiar with integrating applications with ELM, Splulnk and Graylog.
> **Apache Solr** Search Engine

#### Operating Systems
> **Linux, Windows, Solaris, and HP-UX**
> 
> Creating file systems such as LVM, ZFS, NT, user quotas, and System Admistrative tasks - provisioning systems, customize configuration for different applications databases etc, were part of my career. I had worked more three years as systems administrator before coming and Application deployment engineer.

#### Cloud
> AWS, Azure, Proxmox, VSphere

#### Backup Tools
> RapidRecovery, Rubrik

#### IaC, Orchestration, and Configuration Management

#### Containerization
> Docker, Kubernetes

#### Networking
> BigIP F5 Loadbalancing, Fortigate, Microtik

#### More to explore:
> ##### Twingate:
> Remote access service, allows to access private services within cloud or on-prem, for example CI/CD hosted outside, this provides a secure way of accessing it, instead of having own installation of CI/CD.

> ##### Consul
> From HashiCorp. Service Mesh consists of Service discovery, Configuraiton management and Segmentation. 
> **Discovery:** A service networking solution to connect, configure and secure in dynamic infrastructure. A central service registry that uses all dynamically created pods.
> **Configuration management:** K/V pairs 
> **Segmentation (Connect):** Service graph decides which pod can talk other pods. Cert Auth (TLS) will be used to define the service. Proxies uses cert auth (Mutual TLS) - a proxy on each pod can communicate with the proxy on others. Proxies will use service graph to make sure that two pods are allowed to communicate with each other.
